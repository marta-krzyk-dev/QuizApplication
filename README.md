# QuizApplication

The application carries out quiz in 2 stages (eliminations and finale) for 3-15 contestants. 

It was designed specifically to carry out "Co wiesz o Zorach?" contest ("What do you know about Zory?") which is held each year by [Towarzystwo Milosnikow Miasta Zory](http://tmmz.zory.pl/) association. The application is used each year since 2015. 

The application was used in 2015 and 2016 during the 38th and 39th edition of the contest and it is planned to be used furthermore in the future.
